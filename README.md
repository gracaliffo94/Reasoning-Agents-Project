# Abstract
The introduction of regular decision processes, as a form of a non-Markov decision process, has been recently
proposed to study reinforcement learning problems when the transition function depends on the whole history, rather
than only on the current state. We implemented a probably approximately correct algorithm for learning regular
decision processes, based on probabilistic automata learning. We finally did some experiments on three different
domains in order to show the best characteristics that most fit our algorithm.
